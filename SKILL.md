  Generate Game Boy music (.uge) and sound effects (.sav) for GB Studio projects, and render .uge songs to
  looping mp3/wav as Game Boy hardware or as 16-bit (SNES-style) console music. Use this skill whenever the user wants to create chiptune BGM, sound effects, or convert audio files to Game Boy format. Triggers include: any mention of 'BGM', 'SFX', 'UGE', '.uge', 'FX Hammer', '.sav sound', 'Game Boy music', 'GB Studio music', 'chiptune', '8-bit music', '16-bit music', 'SNES music', 'retro game music', 'title theme', 'battle theme', 'sound effects for game', or requests to make music/sounds for a Game Boy or GB Studio project. Also triggers when converting MP3/M4A/WAV to Game Boy format. Use this skill even if the user just says "make me some game music" or "I need a theme song for my game" — if the project is GB Studio or Game Boy related, this skill applies.

# GB Music & SFX Generator

> This copy adds two things to the upstream skill: `scripts/compose.py`, which writes songs from note names, and
> `render/`, which turns a `.uge` into a seamless mp3 loop with a Game Boy or 16-bit voicing. README.md is the guide.
> For music that ships as audio (not into GB Studio), use them:
>
> 1. Write a Python script with `compose.py` (see its docstring and `examples/`). Name instruments after the sound
>    you want ("Flute", "Strings", "Choir", "Harp"...), since the 16-bit renderer picks patches by name.
> 2. Run it to get a `.uge`, then `node render/cli.ts song.uge out.mp3` (default `--style snes`; `--style gb` for
>    hardware sound; `--once` for jingles).
> 3. You cannot hear the result. Check it with numbers (the renderer's tests, ffmpeg `astats`, per-channel levels)
>    and give the user the file to listen to.

Generate Game Boy compatible music (.uge) and sound effects (.sav) programmatically using Python. All output is binary-compatible with GB Studio 4.x.

## Quick Reference

Two output formats:
- **`.uge`** — hUGETracker v6 music files (BGM, jingles). Loops automatically in GB Studio.
- **`.sav`** — FX Hammer sound effect banks. Up to 60 effects per file, played via "Play Sound Effect" event.

## How to Use This Skill

1. Read the user's request to understand genre, mood, tempo, key, duration
2. Choose the appropriate format (.uge for BGM/jingles, .sav for short SFX)
3. Read `references/uge_format.md` for BGM generation or `references/sav_format.md` for SFX
4. Write a Python script using the patterns in `scripts/uge_template.py` or `scripts/sav_template.py`
5. Run it to produce the binary file

## UGE Format Overview

The .uge file is a binary format (little-endian) with this structure:
- Version header (uint32: 6)
- Song name, artist, comment (each: uint8 length + 255 bytes)
- 15 Duty instruments, 15 Wave instruments, 15 Noise instruments (each 1385 bytes)
- 16 waveforms (each 32 bytes)
- Timing: ticks_per_row (uint32), timer_enabled (int8), timer_divider (uint32)
- Patterns: count (uint32), then pattern data (each: uint32 track_key + 64 cells × 17 bytes)
- Sequences: 4 tracks × (uint32 length+1, entries as uint32, uint32 terminator)
- 16 routines (uint32 zeros)

Each cell: uint32 note, uint32 instrument (1-based, 0=none), uint32 unused, uint32 effect_code, uint8 effect_param.

Note values: 0=C3, 12=C4, 24=C5, 36=C6, 90=REST.

Tempo guide: 4=fast/energetic, 5=moderate, 6=relaxed, 7-8=slow/calm, 10+=very slow.

## SAV Format Overview

FX Hammer .sav is a 32,768-byte SRAM dump:
- Magic `"FX HAMMER"` at offset 0x009
- Channel flags at 0x300 (one byte per effect: 0x30=Ch2 pulse, 0x03=Ch4 noise, 0x33=both)
- Effect data at 0x400 + index×0x100 (up to 32 frames × 8 bytes each)

Each frame: duration, ch2_pan, ch2_vol, ch2_duty, ch2_freq, ch4_pan, ch4_vol, ch4_freq.
Duration 0 = end marker. Pan 0x22 = both speakers.

## Audio-to-UGE Conversion

When converting MP3/M4A/WAV to Game Boy format:

1. Install librosa: `pip install librosa --break-system-packages`
2. Analyze: tempo detection, chroma features for key, chord progression via chroma segmentation
3. Melody extraction: use HPSS (harmonic-percussive separation) then pyin pitch detection
4. Map MIDI notes to UGE values: `uge_note = midi_note - 48` (MIDI 48 = C3 = UGE 0)
5. Snap to detected key's scale, normalize octave range
6. Generate .uge with extracted melody on Ch1, chords on Ch2, bass on Ch3, drums on Ch4

Note: polyphonic sources often produce noisy melody extraction. When pyin returns mostly None or flat values, fall back to hand-crafting a melody from the detected chord progression and key.

## Composition Guidelines

### Channel Allocation
- **Ch1 (Duty):** Lead melody — bright, prominent
- **Ch2 (Duty):** Harmony/rhythm — chords, arpeggios, counter-melody
- **Ch3 (Wave):** Bass line — root notes, walking bass
- **Ch4 (Noise):** Percussion — hats, snare, kick, shaker

### SFX Design Patterns

| Sound | Approach |
|-------|----------|
| Hit/Impact | High vol, fast decay, both channels |
| Jump | Ascending pitch sweep (Ch2 only) |
| Coin/Collect | Two quick high notes |
| Explosion/Crash | Max vol noise, slow decay |
| Rolling | Descending pitch + continuous noise |
| Chime/Correct | Two-tone (low→high), sustained |
| Cursor/UI | Single short blip |

## File Size Reference

Expected .uge file sizes (for validation):
- 1 pattern, 1-entry sequence: ~68,102 bytes
- 2 patterns, 2-entry sequence: ~72,486 bytes
- 2 patterns, 4-entry sequence: ~72,518 bytes
- 3 patterns, 4-entry sequence: ~76,886 bytes

## Important Notes

- Instrument index in cells is 1-based (instrument 0 in array → write 1 in cell)
- Pattern keys must be unique: `pattern_index * 4 + track_index`
- Sequence entries reference pattern keys: `sequence_pattern * 4 + track`
- All instruments are exactly 1385 bytes (296 header + 1089 subpattern)
- Subpattern: 1 byte enabled + 64 cells × 17 bytes
- **Noise drums must end up at note 32-63.** 0-31 is nearly silent on hardware and 64+ buzzes. Either write hits at 32-63 without a subpattern, or write C5 and shape the pitch with a subpattern
- **Subpattern notes are relative offsets (36 = ±0), not absolute pitches.** Write noise drum hits as C5 in the pattern and shape the pitch in the instrument's subpattern; raising the pattern note makes the drums buzz ("beeee"). See `references/uge_format.md`
- **Wave output level is the NR32 code: 1 = 100%, 2 = 50%, 3 = 25%** (3 is the quietest, not the loudest). GB Studio writes `level << 5` straight into NR32
- Effect codes: 1 = portamento up, 2 = portamento down, 3 = tone portamento, 0 with a non-zero param = arpeggio (full table in `references/uge_format.md`)
- GB Studio BGM always loops — for one-shot sounds, use .sav format or stop via event
- .sav effects use only Ch2 (pulse) and Ch4 (noise), leaving Ch1 and Ch3 free for music
